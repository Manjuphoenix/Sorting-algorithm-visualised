# Sorting-algorithm-visualised

Hello, welcome to the project of visualising the sorting algorithm by Manjunath and Mohammad Sanaullah.

The main code that performs the required task is just the Actual test.py which is present inside the deploy repository and Sorting.py that is present inside the static repository.
And, Sorting.py holds the algorithm for performing various types of sortings and Actual test.py is the code for client view.

NOTE: Keep both the files (Actual test.py and Sorting.py) inside the same repository to avoid the errors that might arise due to path variables.!!

Here we have followed this architecture just to help if any of u guys want to create your own website using any of the python frameworks.

We have created our own websites using Flask framework, and we made use of the pythonanywhere to host our project the links are given below checkout for reference:
